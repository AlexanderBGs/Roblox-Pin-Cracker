A pin bruteforcer for roblox
Made by Ice Bear#0167. Discord here: (Discontinued)
# How to use
1.) Install python if you haven't already: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2.) Install pip using this link https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

3.) Install the requirements by either running install.bat or doing:

`pip intall termcolor` 

`pip intall random` 

`pip intall requests`

`pip intall random` 

`pip intall time`

`pip intall os`

3.) Run the main.py file then enter your cookie.

4.) Then just wait. The program will let you know when the pin is found on the console or your webhook. It will also alert you off any errors.

The current number will save your progress on which pin the program is trying.
# Warning
It can take up to 29 days to crack the pin assuming their pin is 9999.
There is no way to speed this process up as roblox has very large ratelimits that you can't bypass with proxies.
That's why this tool doesn't waste time using proxies or userAgents.

The program will save the number it was attempting to save your progress.
